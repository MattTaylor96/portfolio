# Portfolio Page

A portoflio page created to display my work. This one-page site uses JavaScript to provide a smooth experience for the user when transitioning between sections. The page also implements HTML5 form validation, responsive design and the use of a PHP script to send emails from the "Contact Us" form.

The live version of this site cna be found at www.MattTaylorDevelopment.com
